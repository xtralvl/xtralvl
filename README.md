## 👋 Hi there,

I'm **xtralvl**, a **Frontend Developer** from **Hungary** 🇭🇺

🎓 I’m currently self-learning on **Codecademy**, practicing on **Codewars** and building multiple projects from the **Frontend Mentor** platform, to prepare for a **full-time frontend course starting in July 2025**.

🎯 My goal is to work on **meaningful, visually engaging web projects**, ideally related to **nature**, **travel**, **history**, or **extreme sports**.

🌍 In the future, I plan to **move to Andalusia, Spain** 🇪🇸.

🛠️ I'm currently working on:
- My **personal portfolio website**
- Projects from the **Frontend Mentor** platform
-
